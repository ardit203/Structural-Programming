### Task 1
A rectangle located in the first quadrant is given. The rectangle is defined by the coordinates (x,y) of the two opposite corners of the rectangle: A (bottom left) and C (top right). The coordinates are integers and are read from SI. After reading the coordinates of the points A and C, the program reads coordinates of two other points (P1 and P2) also from SI. Write a program that, for each of the two points P1 and P2, will print YES if the point lays over the edge of the rectangle (on the sides of the rectangle) or NO otherwise (lays in or outside the rectangle).

### Task 2

A sorted number is a number in which each consecutive digit in a number is smaller than the previous one (going left to right). For example, 7421 is such a number. One-digit numbers should be ignored.

First read one positive whole number N and than additional N numbers from SI. On SO, print all the numbers that are sorted numbers and at the end print the smallest sorted number that was entered.

If the are no such numbers, print only -1 on SO.
