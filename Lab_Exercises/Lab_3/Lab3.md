# Lab Exercises - Structural Programming

## Lab 3

### Task 1
A number N is read from SI. The program should print on SO "Tik" if the number is divisible by 3, "Tak" if the number is divisible by 5 or "Tik-Tak" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5. If the number is not divisible by 3 nor 5, than a message "Bad number" should be printed.

### Task 2
Write a program that for a date read from SI (in the format DD MM YYYY) will print on standard output a message YES if the date is correct and possible, or NO if the date is not correct.

When deciding whether the date is correct or not correct, you have to consider the following factors:
-	is the month between January and December (1-12)
-	does the number for days correspond with the number of days in the specified month
-	if the month is February, is the year leap?
-	Leap years are those years who are divisible with 400, or they are divisible with 4, but not with 100

### Task 3
Write a program that for a three digit number read from SI will check if it is palindrome or not, and will print out an appropriate message. The message is "Palindrome" if it is, and "Not palindrome" if it's not. If the number is not three digit number, write the message "Wrong input".
